Jake Kovalic, undergraduate student, and Jacob Saldinger, PhD candidate, presented posters at the biennial PIC 2019 conference, hosted by Dr. Angela Violi at the University of Michigan. The conference had international attendance. Poster session winners were selected based on design, clarity of the presentation - both of the poster and also when talking to the presenter - and their scientific content.

**Jacob Saldinger** presented a poster, entitled "Characterizing Aromatic Formation in a Coflow Diffusion Flame".

**Jake Kovalic** presented a poster, entitled "Methane Thermal Decomposition: A Case Study For Density-Functional Tight-Binding Molecular Dynamics". He used DFTB and metadynamics to create accurate free energy surfaces for a bond breaking in methane and compared it to previous *ab initio* results. 

CONGRATULATIONS, JACOB AND JAKE!
