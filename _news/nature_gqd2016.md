Chiral nanoparticles are an exciting class of materials that show promise in areas such as optoelectronics, catalysis, bioanalysis and drug delivery. To date, research in chiral nanomaterials has overwhelmingly focused on inorganic (typically, plasmonic) systems. Our recent study on Chiral Graphene Quantum Dots was just selected to Nature highlight. ([Read more](https://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats20166))
