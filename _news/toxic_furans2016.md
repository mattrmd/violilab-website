Oxygenated hydrocarbons produced during combustion can have a wide range of detrimental effects on human health, air quality, and regional and global climate. Many studies have shown that Furans are toxic, whether ingested or inhaled, and thus pose a considerable threat to human health. We used first-principles electronic-structure calculations in conjunction with probabilistic models to study the formation and growth of the particles using atomistic simulations.
