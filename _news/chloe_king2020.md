In her [King Talk](https://rackham.umich.edu/rackham-life/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/king-talks/), Chloe Luyet speaks on the role the food industry has played in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, contributing to overwhelming global bacterial resistance in her talk "How Antibiotics Have Failed Us: The Food Industry's Role in a Global Epidemic".
