Angela Violi and her team are awarded one of the four Blue Sky awards to work on nanobiotics. The Blue Sky Initiative is one of three funding models introduced through the [Research Pillar](http://strategicvision.engin.umich.edu/our-pillars/research) of Michigan Engineeringâ€™s 2020 [Strategic Vision](http://strategicvision.engin.umich.edu/). Utilizing neural networks and machine learning, research hopes to identify nanoparticles which will serve as the next generation of antimicrobials.
